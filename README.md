## Reaction-Timer-Game

<a href="https://reactiontimergame.onrender.com">Visit my website here!</a>

A game based off of <a href="https://humanbenchmark.com/">humanbenchmark</a> that utilizes Vue3 that measures the player's ability to quickly click on a panel when it flashes to GREEN after a random period of time. The game has the player react 5 times, then returns the average of all 5 attempts and outputs to the player whether or not their attempt was above or below the average human's reaction time (273ms).
